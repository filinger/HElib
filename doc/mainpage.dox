/**
   @mainpage HElib Documentation
   HElib is a software library that implements the
   Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) homomorphic encryption scheme, along
   with many optimizations to make homomorphic evaluation runs faster, focusing
   mostly on effective use of the Smart-Vercauteren ciphertext packing
   techniques. HElib is written in C++ and uses the NTL mathematical library.
